# Welcome to Independent Analysis

This site contains critical analysis of political and economic systems, with particular focus on Ukraine and post-Soviet transformations.

## Recent Analysis

The war in Ukraine has exposed fundamental contradictions in the country's system. Our analysis shows that Ukraine is fighting on two fronts simultaneously:
1. Against Russian aggression on territory
2. Against its own parasitic system internally

**Key Finding:** 85% of the war effort comes from ordinary people - soldiers, volunteers, and workers - while 70% of resources go to bureaucratic structures that contribute only 15% of actual value.

*"The greatest tragedy of a people is not when they are oppressed by external enemies, but when they build a system that destroys their future."*
