Independent analyst focusing on political and economic systems, with particular expertise in Ukraine and post-Soviet transformations.

## Recent Analysis

The war in Ukraine has exposed fundamental contradictions in the country's system. Our analysis shows that Ukraine is fighting on two fronts simultaneously:

1. **Against Russian aggression on territory**
2. **Against its own parasitic system internally**

**Key Finding:** 85% of the war effort comes from ordinary people - soldiers, volunteers, and workers - while 70% of resources go to bureaucratic structures that contribute only 15% of actual value.
